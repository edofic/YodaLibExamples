This application contains a sample class Person and two ways to persist it
on the database. 
Classes DatasourceManual and DbHelper are for "manual" work with database, 
annotations on Person and its fields are for automatic datasource generation.

Yay, we replaced 131 lines of bolierplate with four annotations. :)
